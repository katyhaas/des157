			<h3>Topic Summary</h3>
			<p>I plan to look at diversity in design through the lens of mental health and music. I feel like music can be used as a tool to heal in many ways, as it has helped me. There are several forms of music therapy, and through that, people are able to find
				something enjoyable in their life during their darkest times. While it won't claim to be the end-all-be-all, it's meant to be used as a comforting tool to discover new music.</p>

		<div id="col2">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience here is definitely kids around middle school age, to adults. It will probably appeal to those who already really love music, but it could be great for those who want to discover new things. I feel like with the internet nowadays,
				there are many great bands and genres that transcend several generational differences, and can build community. This age range is both seemingly open to new things, and tech savvy</p>
		</div>

		<div id="col1">
			<h3>Goals: Purpose</h3>
			<p>The goal of this project is to give those struggling with mental health, access to songs and discover new music through a visual guide. Music is a great tool to build community (a support system) and to relate to others (through lyrics and representation
				through their meanings). I hope to make it somewhat of a visual "guide" in order for people to search for a song to "cheer them up" or to "relate to their rough day". While it is not meant to be a cure or therapy, I hope to help people come together
				through a music community and finding calming/relatable music.</p>

		<div id="col2">
			<h3>Goals: Visuals</h3>
			<p>Visually, I want to use calming colors to curb any possible anxiety, and lots of white-space/fading animations to make the interface nice and tidy. I hope to have cute illustrations meant to give a welcoming feel to the app. I am still deciding whether
				I want this to be more of a "video game" style where you can control a person to walk around and interact with things, or whether it'll just be more of an accessible app. I want to randomize several different genres and song links/recommendations
				in order to have a variety of options for people when it comes to navigating the interface.</p>
