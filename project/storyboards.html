		<p>During the storyboard brainstorming I learned a lot about the direction I want to move my project in. While I would really love to use VR or something along the lines of Google Cardboard, it just is way too extremely out of my league to learn all there
			is to know and create a whole project in such a short time span. I'm still pretty unfamiliar with the technical aspects of this part of the project, and therefore I feel like it would be better to transfer it to an app or art installation type of project.
			I feel like maybe implementing art therapy would be a good way somehow in order to keep the theme of mental health, and still relate to technology. Drawing through an app/installation might be the way to go, if I'm able to implement it correctly with
			its intended purpose.</p>
