		<p>In my prototyping, I decided to go for a music-based app that helps people struggling to find music based on how they're feeling. There's also options to connect with a web-based community through links at the end as well. It starts off with a mini
			questionnaire where people respond with how they're feeling, what level they like their music, etc. and they get a randomized list of songs based on what they put. Most people like what I had put down, except it was recommended I elaborate a little
			more with certain labels, and cut back on the use of buttons and use more scrolling instead.</p>
