		<h3>forest app</h3>

		<p>Forest is a cute little app that helps people focus on their work, or anything else of their choice, really. The user chooses how long they want to stay focused, and a big timer counts down to that amount, as a tree grows during the time. If the user
			succeeds in not exiting their phone, they receive coins, which can be used to purchase a real-life tree to be planted somewhere! If they fail, the tree that was growing in the app dies, and they’ll have to start all over again.</p>

		<p>I actually found this app pretty effective in the way that it uses its system. It uses pathos in a way to make the user feel bad for causing a virtual tree to die (and not help in planting another tree). The layout of it is simple and streamlined, making
			it easy for people to understand what to do in the first place. I feel like this is a cool way to help people who are easily distracted by technology, specifically their phone, and aid them in leading a more organized routine. I do know that there
			are other apps like this, but I feel like the addition of “coins”, cute tree drawings, and real-life aspects add to the app in a way that makes it more fun. It’s simple and cell-shaded, with not much else going on. If there was one complaint, I would
			have to say that it would only really benefit someone who solely had a problem with being on their phone too much. If it’s a general electronic distraction problem, this probably won’t deter said person from going on their laptop or other electronic
			device that isn’t their phone. However, a lot of the times a small nudge in the right direction works wonders, so I definitely can see how it’s effective in the long-run.</p>

		<h3>pacifica app</h3>

		<img src="/des157/project/photos/pacifica1.PNG" alt="Pacifica example 1">

		<p>Pacifica is an app meant to help heal those who are going through some mental health troubles. You sign up for an account, answer a few questions, and then are led to a front page with multiple different options. Every day, the user gets an option of
			choosing between a guided meditation, a guided goal list, a compilation of uplifting photos, and a lot more. There’s a community page to talk to other users who are using the app, and there’s even a therapy section where you can either find a therapist,
			or share your day-to-day musings from the app with your current therapist. There’s a lot to do!</p>


		<p>At first glance, this app is very pretty. You can even opt to choose your out layout when you first sign up! There’s a bountiful amount of resources, and I feel like the journaling part of it is very helpful for people to get their feelings out in a
			private way. After checking out the forum/community page, the anonymity of it seems very appealing, as you can get uplifting support from others going through similar things as you. There’s nice and uplifting atmosphere throughout the app and it doesn’t
			seem to falter.</p>

		<p>There are a few things that probably need some changing, such as the way the introduction is presented to the new users. As someone who had never previously used the app before, I felt overwhelmed by which part of the app I should start at first. There’s
			somewhat of an introduction at the beginning, but it kind of throws you in there right away, already giving you about 7 options. I feel like this might benefit through a more comprehensive tutorial. I also feel that it would help if there was more
			of an incentive added for those to continue journaling. While that in particular is a good way to aid in mental health healing, it’s difficult for a lot of people to get into a routine. Sometimes the app will send you notifications asking you how you
			were doing, but it’s not necessarily effective enough.</p>
