			<h3>description</h3>
			<p>The audience test was overall a really nice and helpful experience for my project partner and I! Our testers seemed very engaged while they were using our project and had mostly positive things to say about the overarching concept of it. Even though our project was in an unfinished state, they still enjoyed all the interactivity we had already implemented. They both said that the previewing portion of the interactivity was helpful, and that they had fun testing all the different combinations and options that were at their disposal.</p>

			<h3>learning</h3>
			<p>I learned some minor things in reference to music and interface. The audience tester who had a background in sound design suggested we use an fft based code rather than amplitude. This is so our patterns will go at a more smooth and realistic movement. Our second audience tester suggested we keep the preview for the song playing just like all the other attributes of the project (color/pattern/etc). This is so the audience can know what the song sounds like and match things they think are related to the song interface-wise.</p>

			<h3>new gameplan</h3>
			<p>We plan to take both of the ideas from our audience testers. We are going to overhaul the interface experience a little more and focus more on fft/frequency in music rather than amplitude. Overall, the audience testing was a rewarding experience that solidified our project idea and helped us build onto it a little more. It's very helpful to get an outside perspective that doesn't know what we are originally trying to aim for!</p>
