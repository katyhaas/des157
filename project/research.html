<p>For my project, I really want to focus on tech and how you can combine it with forms of therapy in order to treat people and their mental health problems. There are already many initiatives and experiments taking place right now already, however certain fields, such as VR, are fairly newer in their experimental treatment methods.</p>

<p>A big concern that a lot of people seem to have about the integration of tech is the moral questions behind it. Is using something other than pure human interaction really the healthiest option? Are we relying too much on technology to get the job done? There are so many layers to this problem that I believe there isn’t just one solution to a multitude of mental health problems. In an article titled Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment, the National Institute of Mental Health goes over the pros and cons of tech within the mental health treatment process. While there are plenty of pros listed, there’s a lot of concern expressed in terms of regulatory practices (NIMH). Certain forms of tech therapy aren’t looked over due to the pure broadness of the term. This can lead to price discrepancies and the question of who will be the one to regulate the effectiveness and efficiency of the tech materials itself. I believe it is all dependent on what the procedures will be.</p>

<p>Another relation to tech is the internet. The internet is already being used as a huge tool today as a way for people with common interests to connect. This has actually manifested in some ways in which people with suicidal thoughts, or others who are dealing with mental illness, are able to talk about their problems and fears with strangers on the internet (Hess). In this way they are able to relate to others and find an outlet in a way, when in real life they may be too scared to talk to someone physically or verbally. This, of course can manifest in nasty and shocking ways across the internet, as with anything else, however the fact that more people can now get more interaction and help they need than they could’ve gotten before, is an extremely powerful thing. The internet is a fairly new invention, therefore people have gone for years without having an extra outlet like this!</p>

<p>Virtual reality has taken the center stage as kind of the hot, “new” tech. A lot of video games are adapting to the software to make super immersive experiences, and it’s already been utilized several times for simulation purposes. Now, it’s also being used more widely as a tool for cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy. Previously, it was being used sometimes, but it wasn’t as readily available as it’s become now (Senson). PTSD is another big one that virtual reality also addresses, and I feel like this could maybe help address issues with sexual assault trauma, that is a disproportionately big percentage of women. While I wouldn’t be able to necessarily build an entire VR simulation, it would be very exciting to produce some time of environmental graphics addressing this issue in a nuanced way. Design and art can be a powerful thing to address all this big issues.</p>
