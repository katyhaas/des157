		<h1>3 topic ideas for DIS 2018</h1>
	</section>

	<section>

		<div id="col1">
			<h3>Topic 1: mental health</h3>
			<p>• a collection of uplifting sounds and imagery to put people at ease (in relation to anxiety), this can include things like rain, beach waves, etc.; user submitted content and free to use; uplifting words to help put people at ease; maybe both a random
				generator and a search function?; also goes in depth about local resources and step guides for personal help and growth :)</p>
		</div>

		<div id="col2">
			<h3>Topic 2: gender</h3>
			<p>• and interactive game that goes in-depth about gender socialization and expression, and how people react; possibly a customizable avatar?; not sure what the game would be necessarily about, but possibly an interactive visual novel format OR a 8bit
				style platformer; story based on choices and real-life submitted stories about gender discrimination within school/workplace</p>
		</div>

		<div id="col3">
			<h3>Topic 3: school guide</h3>
			<p>• interactive guide to make education accessible to those that cannot afford resources; could either be a guide for applying to college, or a guide once within college? (or both); interactive app, includes quizzes and mini-games; local resources linked for
			each person in whatever areas they are in; also mini lesson articles about the wealth gap and how it is putting people at a disadvantage; combatting the system to help others</p>
